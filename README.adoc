== 🔎 Overview

*Robot-Conga* is a framework for studying **leader–follower sequential path following** in multi-agent robotic systems.  
The project explores coordinated locomotion where one or more leader agents define a trajectory, and follower agents dynamically adjust to maintain a "conga line" formation.  

Applications include:
- Swarm robotics
- Multi-agent coordination
- Reinforcement learning
- Path planning and following
